The included files are The included files are lab1a.c, README, and Makefile.

lab1a.c:
This is the source file, which contains the code for this lab. In short, this code
exploits OS features, specifically, terminal I/O and modes, polled I/O, 
inter-process handling, and exception handling.

README:
This file and its contents.

Makefile:
This Makefile supports differnt targets: default, clean, and dist. Default is the 
default setting that is ran if nothing is specified. Clean removes all unnecessary 
files and returns the current directory to the freshly untared state. Dist is the 
command to create the tarball for submission and distribution.

Misc:
This project was tough. I struggled most with not knowing what the output was 
supposed to be, so I spent days trying to troubleshoot my code that was correct.
With debugging, it was difficult knowing what happens with the chiid and parent 
because I would print out messages in each, but I don't think it signified whether
I was in the parent or the child. 

The discussion slides from the TAs were extremely helpful. Although some of the 
slides were convoluted and confusing, I adapted much of the pseudocode from the 
TAs.
