The included files are The included files are lab1b-client.c, lab1b-server.c, README, and Makefile.

lab1b-server.c:
This is the source file that contains the code for the client.

README:
This file and its contents.

Makefile:
This Makefile supports differnt targets: default, client, server, clean, and dist. Default creates an 
executable for both client and server. Client creates an executable for just client. Server creates an 
executable for just server. Clean removes all unnecessary files and returns the current directory to 
the freshly untared state. Dist is the command to create the tarball for submission and distribution.

Misc:
I failed to finish. It was extremely difficult and I struggled to understand what my output should be.
I also had major difficulties with VSCode and the linux server. For some reason, random .nfs files were
created when running and I couldn't delete them. Eventually, I ran out of disk space on the server, and
my files were corrupted and I had to restart. I had more to say but my brain is fried from redoing my
entire project.
